	abstract = {The 2013 UPS George D. Smith Prize was awarded to the Naval Postgraduate School's (NPS) Operations Research (OR) department for “effective and innovative preparation of students to be good practitioners of operations research, management science or analytics.” In the spirit of the prize, this paper shares details about our degree program. NPS began offering a degree in OR in 1951, making it the first OR degree in the United States. The program is closely linked to its sponsor, the United States Department of Defense (DoD), in a unique relationship that ensures NPS students and faculty are focused on critical and important problems facing the military. Our students bring firsthand knowledge of the challenges our organization faces and leave our academic program as OR practitioners prepared to immediately meet these challenges.},

Coming to the forefront initially during World War II, OR provided critical contributions to logistics, supply chains, and strategic simulation, while enabling superior decision making for Allied forces. OR has grown to include analytics and many applications, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and big data, and is the cornerstone of management science in manufacturing, marketing, telecommunications, and many other fields.  The Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research presents the voices leading OR and analytics to new heights in security through research, practical applications, case studies, and lessons learned in the field.  Features    Applies the experiences of educators and practitioners working in the field    Employs the latest technology developments into case studies and applications    Identifies best practices unique to the military, security, and national defense problem space    Highlights similarities and dichotomies between analyses and trends that are unique to military, security, and defense problems},

	abstract = {The Replenishment at Sea Planner (RASP) is saving the U.S. Navy millions of dollars a year by reducing fuel consumption of its Combat Logistics Force (CLF). CLF shuttle supply ships deploy from ports to rendezvous with underway U.S. combatants and those of coalition partners. The overwhelming commodity transferred is fuel, ship-to-ship by hoses, while other important packaged goods and spare parts are high-lined, or helicoptered between ships. The U.S. Navy is organized in large areas of responsibility called numbered ﬂeets, and within each of these a scheduler must promulgate a daily forecast of CLF shuttle operations. The operational planning horizon extends out several weeks, or as far into the future as we can forecast demand. We solve RASP with integer linear optimization and a purpose-built heuristic. RASP plans Replenishment-at-Sea (RAS) events with 4-hour (Navy watch) time ﬁdelity. For ﬁve years, RASP has served two purposes: (1) it helps schedulers generate a daily schedule and animates it using Google Earth, and (2) it automates reports command-to-ship messages that are essential to keep this complex logistics system operating.},
